00:00:16,863 --> 00:00:19,833
[dramatic music]

2
00:00:16,113 --> 00:00:23,554
*

3
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:22,357
- Get on outta here!

4
00:00:23,117 --> 00:00:25,319
Oh, man.
That is a cub.

5
00:00:24,1000 --> 00:00:26,669
This feeling of remorse hit me

6
00:00:27,472 --> 00:00:28,840
for being so aggressive.

7
00:00:30,776 --> 00:00:33,413
You know, I hate to do it,
but, yeah, I'm gonna tap.

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,152
I'm determined
to make this happen.

9
00:00:35,527 --> 00:00:36,928
Holy [bleep], I got one.

10
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:38,463
How am I gonna keep this going
24 hours a day?

11
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:41,161
[groans]
- Fire blower.

12
00:00:40,889 --> 00:00:43,124
Helps me basically bring
a fire back to life

13
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:46,455
even if there's just
a tiny little coal remaining.

14
00:00:45,062 --> 00:00:47,098
- There is nothing
in my gill net.

15
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:51,503
If I can't get fish,
I'm not gonna make it.

16
00:00:52,222 --> 00:00:53,657
- Oh, my God.
Bears are here.

17
00:00:53,832 --> 00:00:55,834
[cub mewls]
Not good.

18
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,092
- Who are you when everything's
been stripped away?

19
00:00:57,834 --> 00:00:59,335
[bleep].

20
00:00:58,535 --> 00:01:00,136
- [yelping]

21
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,297
- It's scary out here
in these woods.

22
00:01:06,856 --> 00:01:09,125
- I have not had
a serious meal in a week.

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,235
- If I can't get a fire,
then I can't stay here.

24
00:01:10,949 --> 00:01:12,518
- It's always in the back
of your mind,

25
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:13,858
"Well, I could tap out."

26
00:01:14,563 --> 00:01:16,332
- Putting up
with this filming [bleep]?

27
00:02:08,282 --> 00:02:10,284
- Running into a predator,
it's not an if.

28
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:12,364
It's a when.

29
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,710
Get the hell out of here.

30
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:16,329
- I'm living
a hand-to-mouth existence.

31
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:16,929
Yes!
Ah!

32
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,435
- $500,000
is a lot of money.

33
00:02:20,277 --> 00:02:21,678
- It's just gonna keep
getting harder.

34
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:27,093
- It's not the world
that needs to change.

35
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:35,247
It's me
that needs to change.

36
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:36,382
- [moans]

37
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:39,218
*

38
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,034
- [grunts]

39
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:41,501
Ah.

40
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:45,702
- Okay, so this is...
[chuckles]

41
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:48,129
this is almost definitely
the dumbest idea

42
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:49,858
that I've had
since I've been out here.

43
00:02:48,183 --> 00:02:52,387
But it has the potential
to be the funnest idea.

44
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:54,389
[laughing]

45
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:54,156
Yeah.

46
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,054
[grunts]

47
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:02,749
Now I just need
to attach a handle.

48
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:03,467
This is one of those things

49
00:03:02,317 --> 00:03:07,222
that serve no practical
purpose whatsoever,

50
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:08,797
but the one purpose
that it does serve

51
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,698
is huge out here.

52
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:12,446
The hardest part
is really the mental aspect

53
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:13,847
and every single time
I swing out,

54
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:35,173
it puts a smile on my face.

55
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,318
That's huge out here.

56
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,419
[laughing]

57
00:03:46,974 --> 00:03:49,744
Oh, my God.
This is the funnest thing ever!

58
00:03:49,077 --> 00:03:50,411
It's part of life too.

59
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,644
You gotta have things
that you enjoy.

60
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:55,497
You gotta
have things that are fun.

61
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,162
You gotta have things
that make you smile.

62
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:01,646
And that's what this rope swing
has given me.

63
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:04,612
[Tarzan yell]

64
00:04:02,697 --> 00:04:05,466
[laughing]

65
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:09,436
*

66
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:13,418
- My net didn't do too well
out here in the surf.

67
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:14,671
My other stake pulled out.

68
00:04:13,703 --> 00:04:15,639
[grunts]

69
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,725
I am very disappointed
in the performance of this net.

70
00:04:23,068 --> 00:04:25,504
It has caught nothing

71
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:27,386
in the week or so
that it's been up.

72
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,854
Man, head rush.

73
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:31,748
Bent over,
stood up.

74
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,664
Have to learn not do that.

75
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:35,281
So far out of the ocean
I've just had a couple of meals

76
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:36,699
of limpets and
a lot of seaweed.

77
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,833
*

78
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:49,622
Every campsite needs
a place to sit.

79
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:50,956
[exhales sharply]

80
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,127
It doesn't have to look
like a chair.

81
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:55,735
It just has to be a nice,
comfy place to sit.

82
00:04:54,717 --> 00:04:56,753
[exhales sharply]

83
00:04:57,391 --> 00:05:00,394
Chilling on a log
and waiting for low tide.

84
00:04:59,013 --> 00:05:03,384
That's what I'm all about
right now.

85
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,319
I'm hungry.

86
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:05,086
*

87
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:06,937
I'm really hungry.

88
00:05:05,303 --> 00:05:08,572
*

89
00:05:11,794 --> 00:05:14,563
I feel like crap.

90
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:16,428
I don't have a headache,
it doesn't hurt anywhere.

91
00:05:17,995 --> 00:05:20,731
It's not pain; hunger is
a different kind of thing.

92
00:05:19,698 --> 00:05:22,501
Physically, it feels
like apathy,

93
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:23,720
if that makes any sense
at all.

94
00:05:24,682 --> 00:05:27,284
Getting myself motivated
and getting myself moving

95
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,368
is just...

96
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,264
a very hard thing to do.

97
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:32,066
*

98
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,322
I have a SAT phone.

99
00:05:33,402 --> 00:05:38,007
I can leave this experience
at any moment.

100
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:43,302
Stepping out of this suffering
is literally a phone call away.

101
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:43,667
But there's
that $1/2 million prize,

102
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,952
and I think that--

103
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:50,175
that would be a life-changing
amount of money for me to win.

104
00:05:50,604 --> 00:05:55,542
I'd love to have something
to give to my kids.

105
00:05:52,903 --> 00:05:55,906
I'm sick of being the dad
that always has to say no.

106
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:57,856
"Hey, can we go out to dinner?"
"No, you can't."

107
00:05:55,851 --> 00:06:00,656
"Dad, can I ha--"
"No, you can't."

108
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:00,983
Can't afford it,

109
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:03,672
can't afford it,
can't afford it.

110
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:06,378
It's like--it's like
a knee-jerk reaction with me

111
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:09,667
because I've been so...
broke all year.

112
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:10,685
So, yeah, that--
that prize money would be huge.

113
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:11,385
There's just no way
I can go home.

114
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:11,436
I can't go home.

115
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,941
So whatever it is
that I have to

116
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,850
endure out here,
I have to endure it.

117
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:21,964
Whatever it is
I have to put up with,

118
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:25,969
I have to put up
with it.

119
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:26,453
Whatever it is
I have to figure out.

120
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:26,536
I have to figure it out.

121
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:27,421
I have to finish this.

122
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,553
You know, whatever you do,

123
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:04,575
do it all
with the glory of God.

124
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:05,846
I want to do well.

125
00:07:04,361 --> 00:07:07,331
[soft music]

126
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:09,817
*

127
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:06,980
- I should turn
my headlamp off.

128
00:07:03,944 --> 00:07:07,748
So it's, uh, really dark in here
with my headlamp off.

129
00:07:20,851 --> 00:07:25,055
So, uh, I went down
and checked my gill net today,

130
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:27,365
and there was a mom
and two cubs down there.

131
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:29,267
[dramatic music]

132
00:07:25,664 --> 00:07:29,067
The bears are here.
[bleep]

133
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:29,117
- Oh! Mama bear just stood up
on her hind legs.

134
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:27,949
Not good.

135
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:29,017
*

136
00:07:25,681 --> 00:07:29,050
That was, uh,
that was really exciting.

137
00:07:51,425 --> 00:07:54,294
There's a lot
of bear activity right here.

138
00:07:52,454 --> 00:07:56,258
And, you know, predators aren't
something to trifle with.

139
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:58,074
And, uh, I wasn't going
to go disturb them.

140
00:07:57,452 --> 00:07:59,288
Hopefully those bears
will stay on their side

141
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:03,550
of the wa--
of the river.

142
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:07,521
*

143
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,719
I slept great last night.
Oh, my God.

144
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:04,601
Went to bed really early.

145
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:15,526
I got up a little earlier
than usual this morning.

146
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,488
Went out,
did a couple of things,

147
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:19,623
and walked around.
Peed.

148
00:08:17,855 --> 00:08:21,392
Now I gotta go
check my gill net.

149
00:08:24,107 --> 00:08:26,542
I'm guessing it'll be empty
just because

150
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:28,645
salmon aren't running yet,
but one of these mornings

151
00:08:28,484 --> 00:08:30,052
they'll be running.

152
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:32,371
And that'll be
a glorious day.

153
00:08:31,556 --> 00:08:33,924
I'm gonna go this way
just in case

154
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:36,129
the bears are coming out
that way.

155
00:08:34,677 --> 00:08:37,580
I don't wanna
totally shock 'em.

156
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:37,897
I'm not afraid of the bears,
I just don't wanna scare 'em.

157
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:37,046
You know?
'Cause then they get scared,

158
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:38,398
and then scared animals,
in general, do stupid things.

159
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:37,664
Hear big splashing
in the water.

160
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,677
I'm just checking out
this tree line.

161
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:52,095
Looking for--
oh, there they go.

162
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,794
Birds are alarming over there.
There's something over there.

163
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:52,479
Holy crap.

164
00:08:49,393 --> 00:08:51,961
Oh!
Oh, my God.

165
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,794
Oh, my God.
It's big.

166
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,145
[gasps]
That's beautiful.

167
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:17,937
There it is.

168
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:20,206
Glad I went with
the big gill net.

169
00:09:17,204 --> 00:09:18,671
All right, hang on.

170
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:19,505
Okay, well this is it.

171
00:09:16,802 --> 00:09:19,072
I caught my first fish
in my net.

172
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:19,238
It's--
I'm not exaggerating.

173
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:19,872
It's this big.
It's two feet long.

174
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:33,066
Now I gotta make sure I get it
without cutting my gill net.

175
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,951
*

176
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:34,184
I need something to whack it
over the head really hard with,

177
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:33,666
like a stone.

178
00:09:31,765 --> 00:09:34,367
All right, sweetie.
Here we go.

179
00:09:31,581 --> 00:09:34,551
[dramatic music]

180
00:09:32,515 --> 00:09:33,617
*

181
00:09:31,581 --> 00:09:34,550
[dramatic music]

182
00:09:29,095 --> 00:09:37,036
*

183
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:34,534
[water splashing]

184
00:09:31,714 --> 00:09:34,417
- Fish is just too big.

185
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:34,284
Cutting your head off
really is the best idea.

186
00:10:34,826 --> 00:10:36,962
I don't wanna keep it
in misery.

187
00:10:36,118 --> 00:10:39,054
I know.
Try to stay--I know.

188
00:10:36,735 --> 00:10:41,373
Gosh.

189
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:40,872
Just severing the spinal cord
real fast.

190
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,482
There'll be a lot of blood
in this water.

191
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:47,683
Just need to get through--

192
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:47,450
oh, there we go.

193
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:47,249
Oh.

194
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:47,232
These gills are really
bright red.

195
00:10:45,915 --> 00:10:47,049
Just looking out for bears

196
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:06,365
'cause they're gonna
smell blood.

197
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,833
It's not very windy today,
which is good.

198
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:06,933
There we go.

199
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,633
Oh, my God, it's heavy!

200
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,433
This is, like, a feast.

201
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:24,226
I wish there was someone
to share this with.

202
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,494
It's like--
it's really heavy.

203
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,811
It's a big fish.

204
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:25,978
*

205
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,561
Colton, these eyeballs
are big.

206
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:26,245
They're like 3/4 of an inch.

207
00:11:23,492 --> 00:11:24,960
You would love these eyeballs,
Colton.

208
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,310
Look at those.
It's got great eyeballs.

209
00:11:23,191 --> 00:11:25,261
My, uh, my son, Colton,
would love that.

210
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:25,227
When he was little,
someone told him

211
00:11:23,158 --> 00:11:25,294
that if you ate the eyes
of a fish,

212
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:25,360
you could see underwater.

213
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:25,110
And he totally believed that.

214
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:25,010
The size of my thumb,
that eyeball.

215
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,143
Ooh.
I'll cut it out.

216
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,660
I'll eat it in honor of you.

217
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:03,058
I'm gonna do this
kinda right here in the water

218
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:03,926
because when there's blood
coming out,

219
00:12:01,423 --> 00:12:04,693
I don't want the--
I want it to run down.

220
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,226
I don't want it to be
right here.

221
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:04,610
Oh, so slippery.

222
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:04,093
Maybe I can balance it
against--

223
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:04,109
oh, I think it's a male.

224
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:03,976
I see semen.

225
00:12:01,941 --> 00:12:04,176
See all that semen in there?
You see that?

226
00:12:01,206 --> 00:12:04,910
Yeah, this is all--
that's all semen right here.

227
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:04,109
Gotta make sure
there's nothing there.

228
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:04,810
Watch out for bears.
They like it right here.

229
00:12:00,673 --> 00:12:05,443
*

230
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:04,059
All right.

231
00:12:01,473 --> 00:12:04,644
There.
That opened beautifully.

232
00:12:02,091 --> 00:12:04,026
Just beautifully.
Ta-da.

233
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:04,560
So I've got
the center part done.

234
00:12:01,023 --> 00:12:05,094
All right.
Just cut right along the spine

235
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,305
to flatten this fish out.

236
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,290
Oh, my God.
It's beautiful.

237
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,873
All right,
I think I'm bear-free.

238
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,091
We're all competing
for the same thing.

239
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:53,390
And the salmon haven't run yet.
The salmon are late,

240
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:54,007
so the bears are, uh,
the bears are hungry.

241
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,607
Oh, my God.
It's so heavy.

242
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:53,556
It is so much meat.

243
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:54,374
So I've got two huge filets
on either side.

244
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,072
Got the center spine.

245
00:12:51,388 --> 00:12:53,223
I didn't get right up
as much of the spine

246
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:52,939
as I would've liked.

247
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,424
'Cause I'm gonna eat that too,
for sure.

248
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:53,957
Okay, I'm gonna go, uh,
clean all this off.

249
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:53,440
Time to bring it up to camp
and get a fire going.

250
00:12:49,753 --> 00:12:54,858
*

251
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:54,074
Let me show you this
smorgasbord I've got going.

252
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:53,624
I've got salmon in the pan.

253
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:53,390
Salmon that I put between
two tripods.

254
00:12:50,954 --> 00:12:53,657
I've got fresh cedar sticks
smoking.

255
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,373
I'll move it over the fire
when that other one is done

256
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,173
to smoke more.

257
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,473
That smoke is going
right into this piece of fish,

258
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:52,873
which is gonna be great.

259
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:53,440
Later I'll move it
right over the fire.

260
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:53,356
This fish that I have now
I can keep just for a few days

261
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:52,939
and just keep eating off it.

262
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:53,774
As long as I keep it
out of the hands of the bears.

263
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:54,007
Being really careful to keep it
all right on this board

264
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,273
and not to spill any.

265
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:54,474
'Cause what I don't want
are predators coming around,

266
00:12:50,387 --> 00:12:54,223
so I'm going to--
going to make sure that, uh,

267
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,173
that I don't leave anything,
that I burn anything,

268
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,490
and the rest goes way deep
into the ocean.

269
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:54,307
There's my salmon.

270
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,890
I'm just gonna eat.

271
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,506
'Cause it's really good.

272
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:53,123
Oh, my God.

273
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,506
I can't believe
I'm eating this well here.

274
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,890
I am a happy, happy girl.

275
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,790
[soft music]

276
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:56,276
*

277
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,924
- Today, the priorities
are gonna be

278
00:12:50,954 --> 00:12:53,656
I'm gonna work out
a little bit

279
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:54,107
just to, uh...
[snaps fingers]

280
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,423
get my cylinders firing.

281
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:53,974
Uh, 'cause they're not
right now at all.

282
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,640
I'm not a huge gym buff,
you know?

283
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,473
I'm not, like,
a "bro guy," you know?

284
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,640
But, uh,
I enjoy working out.

285
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:03,859
So what I've done is
I've built, basically, a gym.

286
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:05,327
All right, we got, uh...

287
00:15:04,098 --> 00:15:09,404
two new additions
to the gym...

288
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:10,855
AKA: Muscle Beach.

289
00:15:07,402 --> 00:15:11,406
'Cause it's a beach
and it's the gym.

290
00:15:08,403 --> 00:15:10,405
First we've brought over
the, uh,

291
00:15:08,286 --> 00:15:10,521
chain that I found.

292
00:15:08,002 --> 00:15:10,805
And also...

293
00:15:08,136 --> 00:15:10,671
my new pull-up bar.

294
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:10,972
Yep.
That happened.

295
00:15:07,818 --> 00:15:10,989
Just knock this out.

296
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,688
I enjoy being
physically active, you know?

297
00:15:06,984 --> 00:15:11,823
And I think that it's
an underrated part of survival.

298
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:11,105
I look at survival,
especially long-term like this,

299
00:15:08,686 --> 00:15:10,121
as living.

300
00:15:08,286 --> 00:15:10,521
You know, I work out
in my own life.

301
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,688
Why wouldn't I work out
out here?

302
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,588
I think some of this comes
from being in the military

303
00:15:08,403 --> 00:15:10,405
for so long as well.

304
00:15:08,636 --> 00:15:10,171
I'm not gonna do it
to the point

305
00:15:07,786 --> 00:15:11,022
to where, you know,
I'm expending so many calories

306
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:10,388
that I'm just draining myself.

307
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:10,755
But it keeps
my motivation levels up.

308
00:15:07,335 --> 00:15:11,472
It keeps, you know,
kinda everything up.

309
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:10,588
Finding things that
you can enjoy

310
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:10,138
even though
the weather's horrible

311
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:11,105
or, you know, it's kind of
a miserable existence,

312
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:10,555
makes a huge, huge impact

313
00:15:07,385 --> 00:15:11,422
rather than just kind of
sitting there waiting it out.

314
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:10,838
[groans]

315
00:15:08,637 --> 00:15:10,171
Think when I, uh...
[chuckles]

316
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:10,989
when I get back,
maybe I should start

317
00:15:07,402 --> 00:15:11,406
a survival workout program.

318
00:15:08,503 --> 00:15:10,305
That's not gonna happen.

319
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:13,374
*

320
00:15:06,684 --> 00:15:12,123
- I never realized sea otters
are such a big creature.

321
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:10,605
They're like the size
of a small dog.

322
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:11,005
*

323
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:11,206
What a happy life,
just float around on your back.

324
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:10,605
Go down, eat some seafood.

325
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:10,472
Come back up.

326
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:10,438
Float around on your back,
swim around,

327
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:10,772
play with your buddies.
That's a cool animal.

328
00:15:07,402 --> 00:15:11,406
*

329
00:15:08,753 --> 00:15:10,054
I'm thinking
what I need to do

330
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,137
is catch some
of those sea otters

331
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,438
and train them

332
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,888
to bring me fish.

333
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:10,755
*

334
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:11,706
They have my cove
all figured out.

335
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:10,255
This cove is my universe.

336
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:11,572
And I have to adapt myself
to it.

337
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,889
I just have to make use
of what is here

338
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,889
and figure it out
and just stay alive.

339
00:15:07,668 --> 00:15:11,139
I've got an idea
for active fishing.

340
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:11,506
I can see that there's fish
swimming in the kelp

341
00:15:08,403 --> 00:15:10,405
just below my point here.

342
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,688
And this is the first time
I've actually seen fish

343
00:15:07,102 --> 00:15:11,706
of a size that I can eat
swimming in my waters.

344
00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:11,740
So that means I have to try
and catch some of these fish.

345
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:10,438
Okay now, the secret to doing
a cane pole

346
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:10,605
is you don't just tie
the string

347
00:15:07,518 --> 00:15:11,289
onto the end of the pole.

348
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:10,789
You tie yourself
a safety line

349
00:15:07,785 --> 00:15:11,022
back below.

350
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:10,455
*

351
00:15:08,302 --> 00:15:10,505
So if the end
of the pole breaks off,

352
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:10,455
you don't lose everything.

353
00:15:07,636 --> 00:15:11,172
*

354
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:10,872
I am desperately hungry
right now.

355
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:11,573
And I want to eat.

356
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:11,255
That's pretty much
the end of the story for me.

357
00:15:07,952 --> 00:15:10,855
*

358
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:10,822
Oh, man.
That one stole half my bait.

359
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:09,921
They're hitting it though.

360
00:15:07,535 --> 00:15:11,272
*

361
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:09,954
Ah!

362
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:13,374
*

363
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:10,371
Yes!

364
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:13,374
*

365
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:10,438
- Two weeks out here
and no fish to show for it.

366
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:10,221
That's embarrassing.
I'm sorry.

367
00:15:08,303 --> 00:15:10,505
I'm at the point now
of total embarrassment

368
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:10,572
that I have not
caught a fish.

369
00:15:08,453 --> 00:15:10,355
I'm hungry.

370
00:15:08,637 --> 00:15:10,171
I'm really hungry.

371
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:10,672
* *

372
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:10,638
Yes!

373
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:10,705
Yeah, baby!

374
00:15:08,653 --> 00:15:10,155
Oh, yes.

375
00:15:08,136 --> 00:15:10,671
That's a big ol' fish.

376
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:10,872
I'm gonna have a meal.

377
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:10,589
I'm gonna have a meal!

378
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:10,572
*

379
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:10,705
Oh, thank you, Lord.

380
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,238
*

381
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:10,472
Oh, I gotta go make
some fish stew.

382
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:11,506
That is a good feeling.

383
00:15:08,136 --> 00:15:10,672
*

384
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:10,622
It is a lot easier doing this
waist-high

385
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:10,788
than down on the ground.

386
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,688
*

387
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:10,371
I'm a happy man.

388
00:15:08,303 --> 00:15:10,505
This has definitely taken away
that hollow feeling

389
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:10,472
that I've had
for the last several days.

390
00:15:08,386 --> 00:15:10,422
It gave me hope today.
It really did.

391
00:15:08,403 --> 00:15:10,405
It really gave me hope.

392
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:10,204
I just want to do well
at this thing, you know?

393
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:10,572
I just want
to make my kids proud

394
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:11,873
and let them see their dad
persevere and tough it out.

395
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:10,371
I can feed myself here.

396
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,388
And I need to do that
on a regular basis

397
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:10,955
to stay here as long
as I possibly can.

398
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:10,371
[exhales deeply]

399
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:10,872
Thank you, Lord
for this food.

400
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:10,471
Oh, that is good.

401
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,888
[soft music]

402
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:13,374
*

403
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:10,705
- When I lost my ferro rod,

404
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:10,455
I wanted to go home.

405
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:10,222
I need to get my head
back in the game

406
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:10,538
if I'm gonna do this.

407
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:10,905
I can't just sit around
and hope for--

408
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:09,954
hope for the best.

409
00:15:07,869 --> 00:15:10,939
I need to take action.

410
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:11,689
I'm gonna start on
a permanent structure today.

411
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:11,489
I'm gonna do it using
two different structural pieces

412
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:10,205
to hold it all together.

413
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:10,822
I'm gonna be pounding posts
into the ground,

414
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:10,872
and then I'm going to take
a piece of cord,

415
00:15:07,402 --> 00:15:11,406
and I'm gonna wrap the cord
around each of the posts

416
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:10,455
to be able to just
hold it all together.

417
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:10,605
And then the other way
is I'm going to, uh,

418
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:11,206
actually notch
each of the logs

419
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:11,139
sort of log cabin style.

420
00:15:08,503 --> 00:15:10,304
I'm doing this for two reasons.

421
00:15:07,886 --> 00:15:10,922
You know, one, obviously having
a long-term shelter

422
00:15:06,935 --> 00:15:11,873
and having some comfort
is gonna improve my morale.

423
00:15:08,202 --> 00:15:10,605
It's gonna
just make me happier.

424
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:10,621
Also, two...

425
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:11,156
winter is coming.

426
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:10,455
This is one of those projects
that is gonna require

427
00:15:08,136 --> 00:15:10,672
a lot of energy.

428
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:11,272
It's a lot of work going on
very, very little food.

429
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:10,789
I haven't really eaten any...

430
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:10,488
any meat, so...

431
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:10,755
I'm definitely, like,
running pretty low on fuel.

432
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:10,621
Got my trout line out
and traps.

433
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:10,905
That's my first real attempt
at getting some food,

434
00:15:07,786 --> 00:15:11,022
but I need to have
a consistent source of food.

435
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:11,639
The process of doing this
without anybody else...

436
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:11,556
the isolation, you know,
is difficult.

437
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:10,438
It does get to you.

438
00:15:06,985 --> 00:15:11,822
Just start to search for
things to--

439
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:10,255
to communicate with.

440
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:10,638
Even if it's yourself.

441
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,638
You know, like you start having
conversations in your head

442
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:10,638
where you're talking
to yourself,

443
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,287
and you're saying "we."

444
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:10,822
I'm like, "All right, well what
are we going to do today?"

445
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:10,088
"We"?
What am I talking about?

446
00:15:08,403 --> 00:15:10,405
There's no "we."
It's just me out here.

447
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,438
And that is arguably
the most difficult part

448
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:10,471
of this journey.

449
00:15:07,735 --> 00:15:11,072
So these are the walls
on the inside.

450
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:11,006
Barely even see.
Let's turn on the infrared.

451
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:10,722
So that's as high
as my back wall is gonna be.

452
00:15:07,535 --> 00:15:11,272
It's basically just a log cabin
lean-to essentially.

453
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,688
Here's what it looks like
from the outside.

454
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:10,621
[chuckles]

455
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:10,455
Amazing.

456
00:15:07,352 --> 00:15:11,456
The process has been definitely
laborous and exhausting.

457
00:15:07,535 --> 00:15:11,272
And it's taking a lot
of calories out of me.

458
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,937
[groans]

459
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:10,972
[bleep], I'm hungry.

460
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,889
[soft music]

461
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:13,375
*

462
00:15:08,536 --> 00:15:10,272
- All right.

463
00:15:07,685 --> 00:15:11,122
I gotta get moving 'cause
it's a little chill in the air.

464
00:15:08,487 --> 00:15:10,321
I could see my breath last night
when I went to bed.

465
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,288
[exhales]

466
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:12,007
*

467
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,488
It's really feeling
like the rain is coming.

468
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,538
And I have a feeling
once the rain comes.

469
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,238
we're just in for the rain.

470
00:15:07,018 --> 00:15:11,789
It's not gonna stop,
so getting ready.

471
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:11,389
This is the front
of my shelter.

472
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,838
So I've started to put
a door in.

473
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:10,488
These are my final--
this post on the left

474
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:10,872
and this post on my right
are my final two beams.

475
00:15:08,136 --> 00:15:10,672
This thing leaning in here...

476
00:15:08,536 --> 00:15:10,271
it's going to be my door

477
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:10,972
that will come in and out.

478
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:10,955
*

479
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:10,722
There are some big storms
that come through here.

480
00:15:08,153 --> 00:15:10,655
*

481
00:15:08,302 --> 00:15:10,505
I know that the storms
are gonna hit really soon,

482
00:15:07,752 --> 00:15:11,055
and rain is just gonna be...
[whooshing]

483
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:11,990
This door fits pretty snugly.

484
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:11,039
Now I'm reinforcing the front
of this structure

485
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:10,788
to make sure that
the whole thing is covered.

486
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:10,589
Hopefully this will keep both

487
00:15:08,453 --> 00:15:10,355
the warmth in
and the cold out,

488
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:11,255
but also the wind out
as well.

489
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:11,906
Perhaps we'll see
rain tonight.

490
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,889
[dramatic music]

491
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:13,375
*

492
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:10,755
- Well, I wouldn't want to be
out on a raft

493
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:10,822
on this.

494
00:15:07,786 --> 00:15:11,022
Normally this water's
really calm.

495
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:10,989
Just passive.

496
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:10,638
It's just super rocky today.

497
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:11,956
The wind has been
going crazy fast.

498
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:11,156
Like tornado.

499
00:15:07,835 --> 00:15:10,972
I don't know.
I mean, I'd say...

500
00:15:06,918 --> 00:15:11,890
probably, you know,
40-50 mile an hour winds easy.

501
00:15:07,752 --> 00:15:11,055
Just, you know, kicking.

502
00:15:07,585 --> 00:15:11,222
*

503
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:10,388
And now it's raining.

504
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:10,755
And I gotta go back to camp.

505
00:15:08,803 --> 00:15:10,004
[bleep].

506
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:10,955
*

507
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:10,138
All right.

508
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:10,488
[groans]

509
00:15:08,703 --> 00:15:10,104
[grunts]

510
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:13,375
*

511
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:10,872
[heavy raindrops]

512
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:10,789
- Yeah, hey.

513
00:15:07,418 --> 00:15:11,389
It's really coming down,
so I have the, uh,

514
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,088
thought I'd turn
the audio on here.

515
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:10,071
[heavy raindrops]

516
00:15:07,952 --> 00:15:10,855
My, uh, lean-to
is not leaking at all.

517
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:10,789
We have had intense rain,
so...

518
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:10,455
I feel really snug.

519
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:10,488
It is really dark though.

520
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:10,672
I'm, uh, getting ready to go.

521
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,307
Got my raincoat on,

522
00:27:28,373 --> 00:27:30,242
and I'm gonna go check
my gill net.

523
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:30,508
And the storm's going...
[whooshing]

524
00:27:28,256 --> 00:27:30,358
King of whipping around.

525
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:30,509
It's really sheltered in this,
uh, in this hut.

526
00:27:28,673 --> 00:27:29,941
I don't think you can hear it
as much

527
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:30,275
as is actually going on.

528
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,775
Whoo.

529
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:30,275
Ahh!

530
00:27:28,256 --> 00:27:30,358
Oh, my God,
I'm getting blown over!

531
00:27:28,122 --> 00:27:30,492
Wow, that was crazy.

532
00:27:27,338 --> 00:27:31,276
My gill net
is way underwater.

533
00:27:28,123 --> 00:27:30,492
Looks...

534
00:27:28,256 --> 00:27:30,358
I think a lot of it's
showing,

535
00:27:28,707 --> 00:27:29,908
but I can't get to it.

536
00:27:28,506 --> 00:27:30,108
It's way too--

537
00:27:26,721 --> 00:27:31,893
It seems like the water's
really just blowing...

538
00:27:27,756 --> 00:27:30,859
in, which is--

539
00:27:28,256 --> 00:27:30,359
like, the waves are coming
and making it hard to get to--

540
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,074
to the--that area.

541
00:27:28,306 --> 00:27:30,308
I'll have to keep
watching it today.

542
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,682
Yeah, it's really raining.

543
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:35,683
I'm gonna, um,
I'm gonna head back to camp

544
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,183
and, uh,
before I get gusted away here.

545
00:29:33,297 --> 00:29:36,066
Just kinda get settled in
for the day.

546
00:29:33,197 --> 00:29:36,166
[dramatic music]

547
00:29:31,712 --> 00:29:37,651
*

548
00:29:33,914 --> 00:29:35,450
- I came out to the beach
this morning

549
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,183
just to check things out.

550
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,967
This is about as high tide
as high gets.

551
00:29:53,776 --> 00:29:56,012
And the surf
is just amazing here.

552
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:56,746
I've never seen it
this rough.

553
00:30:16,269 --> 00:30:19,840
That's where I clean my fish,
on that twisty-looking thing

554
00:30:18,605 --> 00:30:21,074
where the surf is
beating down right now.

555
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:21,041
If I was to go fishing,
that's where I'd go fishing.

556
00:30:18,321 --> 00:30:21,358
All the way out there.

557
00:30:18,372 --> 00:30:21,308
I would have to cross
all that water

558
00:30:18,689 --> 00:30:20,991
to get to my fishing spot.

559
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:21,091
Normally at low tide,
I can walk out there.

560
00:30:43,315 --> 00:30:46,218
Look at it now.
It's just surf.

561
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:48,387
And this is--this is as rough
as I've seen it.

562
00:30:44,182 --> 00:30:48,253
The water is murky
and evil-looking.

563
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,086
*

564
00:30:57,132 --> 00:31:00,702
This is a tragedy, people.

565
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:03,805
My giant twisty kitchen thing
is drifting out to sea.

566
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:02,071
That is the most important
feature of my beach,

567
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:03,321
and it's leaving.
Come on, don't go! No!

568
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:01,670
No!

569
00:30:59,217 --> 00:31:02,187
[dramatic music]

570
00:30:56,732 --> 00:31:04,673
*

571
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:02,170
- I'm so scared.

572
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:01,670
[chuckles]

573
00:30:59,768 --> 00:31:01,636
[coughs]

574
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:01,920
Oh.

575
00:30:59,634 --> 00:31:01,770
The wind is really crazy.

576
00:32:16,803 --> 00:32:19,238
It's not raining too much,

577
00:32:16,752 --> 00:32:21,724
but the wind
is just going nuts.

578
00:32:20,015 --> 00:32:23,152
Don't really have much to do

579
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:24,033
in the way
of chores or work.

580
00:32:22,581 --> 00:32:25,484
Everything is pretty--

581
00:32:22,615 --> 00:32:25,451
pretty much revolving
around food.

582
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:31,891
And tide's about halfway up,

583
00:32:30,422 --> 00:32:33,359
so there's no food to get.

584
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:35,881
I might just hunker down
in here.

585
00:32:34,013 --> 00:32:37,749
You know, over the course
of active duty in the military,

586
00:32:38,075 --> 00:32:42,045
years of my life
had been spent in isolation.

587
00:32:41,144 --> 00:32:42,946
You're sitting in a tiny hole
with, you know,

588
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,608
a couple of other guys

589
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,275
for three, four, or five days.

590
00:32:49,246 --> 00:32:51,449
And you're pissing
and [bleep] in a bag, you know.

591
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:54,438
You learn things to do
to kinda entertain your mind.

592
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,556
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

593
00:32:55,466 --> 00:32:57,568
the moment that probably

594
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:59,668
none of you
have been waiting for,

595
00:32:59,034 --> 00:33:00,302
other than me.

596
00:32:58,651 --> 00:33:00,686
When I first saw
this bad boy,

597
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:11,056
I was thinking,
"That is a tube.

598
00:33:09,127 --> 00:33:13,198
And I can use the tube
for a lot of cool stuff."

599
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:15,060
And hopefully we can
give it a little--

600
00:33:14,457 --> 00:33:16,526
little test drive here.

601
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:17,994
And that is a win.

602
00:33:22,052 --> 00:33:25,222
No longer do I have to leave

603
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:26,967
the comfort of my room

604
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:29,086
to urinate
in the middle of the night.

605
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:28,536
Believe it or not,
it's a pretty big moment.

606
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:33,569
[soft music]

607
00:33:29,598 --> 00:33:37,539
*

608
00:33:32,501 --> 00:33:34,636
- Rainy day, windy day.

609
00:33:36,505 --> 00:33:38,473
Very windy day.

610
00:33:36,654 --> 00:33:40,291
Wouldn't want to be out at sea
on a day like this.

611
00:33:37,655 --> 00:33:39,291
*

612
00:33:37,021 --> 00:33:39,924
I'm gonna go walk over--
walk over to the fish net.

613
00:33:37,538 --> 00:33:39,407
See if I can rescue it.

614
00:33:37,272 --> 00:33:39,674
Let's see what
the situation is.

615
00:34:00,857 --> 00:34:02,525
A lot of stuff in the net.

616
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:04,547
Like kelp pieces and whatnot.

617
00:34:03,796 --> 00:34:05,298
You have to go in the water.

618
00:34:20,115 --> 00:34:23,518
We're basically freeing it
then make it work again.

619
00:34:22,902 --> 00:34:25,705
That's the last darn day

620
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:27,074
a guy would want to be
wading in the water here,

621
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,609
but it's hard to see
how deep it is.

622
00:34:26,057 --> 00:34:28,092
Ooh.

623
00:34:44,003 --> 00:34:45,605
[grunts]

624
00:34:49,316 --> 00:34:51,851
It's already past
knee-deep here.

625
00:34:50,981 --> 00:34:54,919
Probably going to drown here
like an idiot.

626
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:56,287
And the wind picks up
some more.

627
00:34:53,117 --> 00:34:56,721
*

628
00:34:58,106 --> 00:35:00,075
What a tangle.

629
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:01,092
*

630
00:34:59,107 --> 00:35:01,042
[grunts]

631
00:34:58,991 --> 00:35:01,159
Lot of kelp.

632
00:35:05,135 --> 00:35:08,571
Oh, man. I could do without
these waves, I tell you.

633
00:35:06,302 --> 00:35:10,841
*

634
00:35:09,371 --> 00:35:12,474
Huh.
There's a salmon in here.

635
00:35:11,323 --> 00:35:13,625
Lordy!

636
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:20,959
Well, that's a reward.

637
00:35:19,775 --> 00:35:22,144
Salmon.

638
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:22,128
Not too big, but not bad.

639
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:23,095
[heavy raindrops]

640
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:50,561
I don't know if you folks
can even hear anything.

641
00:35:47,624 --> 00:35:53,497
'Cause it's raining
about as hard as it can

642
00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:54,077
but I'm eating salmon.

643
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:57,187
so I don't care.

644
00:35:57,167 --> 00:36:00,671
I'm having the best meal...

645
00:35:58,552 --> 00:36:02,790
I've had
since I've come here.

646
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,783
So the salmon are coming
towards the coast.

647
00:36:08,381 --> 00:36:10,783
They're looking for places.

648
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:12,268
[dramatic music]

649
00:36:06,812 --> 00:36:14,753
*

650
00:36:16,412 --> 00:36:18,348
- Good morning.

651
00:36:19,196 --> 00:36:22,299
It's another beautiful day
here in British Columbia.

652
00:36:24,168 --> 00:36:26,104
What else can I say?

653
00:36:25,663 --> 00:36:28,533
Gonna walk down and...

654
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:30,941
gonna check my traps.

655
00:36:29,139 --> 00:36:32,742
*

656
00:36:29,222 --> 00:36:32,660
Trap number one.

657
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:06,159
Not triggered.

658
00:37:07,998 --> 00:37:10,901
And the bait is gone.

659
00:37:10,183 --> 00:37:11,618
Man.

660
00:37:17,366 --> 00:37:20,969
I need to figure out a way
to make this way more sensitive.

661
00:37:17,131 --> 00:37:24,806
*

662
00:37:26,156 --> 00:37:28,892
- Think I'm gonna try
to start eating these slugs.

663
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,713
I don't want to, but...

664
00:37:32,575 --> 00:37:33,977
I'm getting pretty hungry.

665
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:36,246
*

666
00:37:33,493 --> 00:37:34,461
Next trap.

667
00:37:32,576 --> 00:37:35,379
*

668
00:37:32,976 --> 00:37:34,978
Triggered.

669
00:37:50,513 --> 00:37:52,782
Do we have anything
to show for it?

670
00:37:51,297 --> 00:37:54,267
*

671
00:37:59,021 --> 00:38:00,956
Oh, my God.
Look at that.

672
00:37:59,472 --> 00:38:02,441
*

673
00:37:56,986 --> 00:38:04,927
*

674
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:44,157
- Nice.

675
00:38:44,682 --> 00:38:47,785
A little mouse.

676
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:50,507
My first bit of meat
in 14 days.

677
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,683
All right, well let's cook up
our mousey-mouse here.

678
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:54,303
What I like to do is just...

679
00:38:54,872 --> 00:38:57,240
singe all the hair off.

680
00:39:00,935 --> 00:39:03,638
So this guy is all singed.

681
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:06,225
And then you could just...

682
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:07,968
you don't need to spend
too much time

683
00:39:08,127 --> 00:39:09,428
skinning him or anything.

684
00:39:08,574 --> 00:39:11,811
You just sort of peel
the singed hair off.

685
00:39:10,787 --> 00:39:13,557
I'm super excited to eat this
right now.

686
00:39:16,177 --> 00:39:17,746
You could just peel open
the stomach

687
00:39:18,782 --> 00:39:20,116
to take out the guts.

688
00:39:18,777 --> 00:39:22,847
But I leave in, like,
the heart and the liver.

689
00:39:21,879 --> 00:39:23,814
Delicious.

690
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:23,731
Mm-hmm.

691
00:39:28,758 --> 00:39:32,897
And I'll just throw him
directly on the coals there.

692
00:39:32,113 --> 00:39:33,681
Just let him cook.

693
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,915
*

694
00:39:40,249 --> 00:39:44,720
I feel like I'm starting
to find my pace.

695
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:46,325
I'm starting to connect more
with the land.

696
00:39:45,744 --> 00:39:50,148
But I'm just not
pulling in any fish.

697
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,916
*

698
00:39:50,616 --> 00:39:52,618
So I don't know.

699
00:39:53,154 --> 00:39:55,390
I gotta try
some new fishing techniques.

700
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:59,333
Gotta try to make a living
off the sea.

701
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:01,646
Because when winter comes here,

702
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:04,501
animals are gonna be holed up
and might not be there,

703
00:40:02,705 --> 00:40:06,342
so I gotta figure out a way
to get some fish.

704
00:40:04,623 --> 00:40:08,061
*

705
00:40:05,374 --> 00:40:07,309
Little leg.

706
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:06,809
Mmm.

707
00:40:11,717 --> 00:40:13,652
And that's the only bit
that's left.

708
00:40:42,904 --> 00:40:44,373
Just the teeth.

709
00:40:45,669 --> 00:40:47,637
The teeth are just too hard.

710
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,858
Actually, no, they're fine.

711
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,180
All gone.

712
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,638
[sighs]

713
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:01,292
Well, that's it.

714
00:41:07,525 --> 00:41:10,460
Breakfast of champions there.

715
00:41:11,474 --> 00:41:14,777
- If I end up in the drink
and swimming,

716
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:20,742
then this could be
the end of my journey today.

717
00:41:19,714 --> 00:41:21,749
- You build and you build
and you build,

718
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,781
and when you run out of things,

719
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,439
then you're just sort of
left here.

720
00:41:26,138 --> 00:41:28,474
- A mouse has completely
destroyed my gear.

721
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:30,054
I swear to God if that thing
chews my sleeping bag up,

722
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,871
I'm blowing this place up.

723
00:41:32,476 --> 00:41:34,445
- I've never been alone
for this long before.

724
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:36,023
I am craving
human companionship.

725
00:41:35,938 --> 00:41:38,807
- I really miss
my loved ones.

726
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:44,896
Oh.

727
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:49,735
