00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,975
[dramatic music]

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:15,449
*

3
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:16,584
- Get on outta here!

4
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,819
Oh, man.
That is a cub.

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,521
This feeling of remorse hit me

6
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:21,922
for being so aggressive.

7
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,592
You know, I hate to do it,
but, yeah, I'm gonna tap.

8
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,327
I'm determined
to make this happen.

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,761
Holy [bleep], I got one.

10
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,663
How am I gonna keep this going
24 hours a day?

11
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,599
[groans]
- Fire blower.

12
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,867
Helps me basically bring
a fire back to life

13
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:36,737
even if there's just
a tiny little coal remaining.

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,806
- There is nothing
in my gill net.

15
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,608
If I can't get fish,
I'm not gonna make it.

16
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,076
- Oh, my God.
Bears are here.

17
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,112
[cub mewls]
Not good.

18
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:46,514
- Who are you when everything's
been stripped away?

19
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,048
[bleep].

20
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:49,683
- [yelping]

21
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,885
- It's scary out here
in these woods.

22
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:54,188
- I have not had
a serious meal in a week.

23
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:56,557
- If I can't get a fire,
then I can't stay here.

24
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,159
- It's always in the back
of your mind,

25
00:00:58,192 --> 00:00:59,627
"Well, I could tap out."

26
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,429
- Putting up
with this filming [bleep]?

27
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:03,464
- Running into a predator,
it's not an if.

28
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:04,465
It's a when.

29
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:07,535
Get the hell out of here.

30
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,470
- I'm living
a hand-to-mouth existence.

31
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:10,704
Yes!
Ah!

32
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,573
- $500,000
is a lot of money.

33
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,007
- It's just gonna keep
getting harder.

34
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,576
- It's not the world
that needs to change.

35
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:18,179
It's me
that needs to change.

36
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,481
- [moans]

37
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:28,456
*

38
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:56,517
- [grunts]

39
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,294
Ah.

40
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,864
- Okay, so this is...
[chuckles]

41
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:14,702
this is almost definitely
the dumbest idea

42
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,505
that I've had
since I've been out here.

43
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:21,742
But it has the potential
to be the funnest idea.

44
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:28,749
[laughing]

45
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:32,320
Yeah.

46
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:33,687
[grunts]

47
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:37,024
Now I just need
to attach a handle.

48
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:38,892
This is one of those things

49
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:43,831
that serve no practical
purpose whatsoever,

50
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:47,134
but the one purpose
that it does serve

51
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,969
is huge out here.

52
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,473
The hardest part
is really the mental aspect

53
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,309
and every single time
I swing out,

54
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:56,944
it puts a smile on my face.

55
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,212
That's huge out here.

56
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:00,448
[laughing]

57
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:03,251
Oh, my God.
This is the funnest thing ever!

58
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:04,618
It's part of life too.

59
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,186
You gotta have things
that you enjoy.

60
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,821
You gotta
have things that are fun.

61
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,557
You gotta have things
that make you smile.

62
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,725
And that's what this rope swing
has given me.

63
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,363
[Tarzan yell]

64
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:18,165
[laughing]

65
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:26,139
*

66
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:37,150
- My net didn't do too well
out here in the surf.

67
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:40,120
My other stake pulled out.

68
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:44,292
[grunts]

69
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:51,064
I am very disappointed
in the performance of this net.

70
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,534
It has caught nothing

71
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,804
in the week or so
that it's been up.

72
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,773
Man, head rush.

73
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:02,776
Bent over,
stood up.

74
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,745
Have to learn not do that.

75
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:11,785
So far out of the ocean
I've just had a couple of meals

76
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,655
of limpets and
a lot of seaweed.

77
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,791
*

78
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:21,329
Every campsite needs
a place to sit.

79
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:24,031
[exhales sharply]

80
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,533
It doesn't have to look
like a chair.

81
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,668
It just has to be a nice,
comfy place to sit.

82
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,737
[exhales sharply]

83
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,773
Chilling on a log
and waiting for low tide.

84
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:37,177
That's what I'm all about
right now.

85
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,079
I'm hungry.

86
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,516
*

87
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,517
I'm really hungry.

88
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:46,820
*

89
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:49,623
I feel like crap.

90
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:52,292
I don't have a headache,
it doesn't hurt anywhere.

91
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:55,062
It's not pain; hunger is
a different kind of thing.

92
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,898
Physically, it feels
like apathy,

93
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,368
if that makes any sense
at all.

94
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:03,003
Getting myself motivated
and getting myself moving

95
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,205
is just...

96
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,508
a very hard thing to do.

97
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:11,144
*

98
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,213
I have a SAT phone.

99
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:17,851
I can leave this experience
at any moment.

100
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:23,891
Stepping out of this suffering
is literally a phone call away.

101
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:28,328
But there's
that $1/2 million prize,

102
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:30,931
and I think that--

103
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:34,334
that would be a life-changing
amount of money for me to win.

104
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:39,306
I'd love to have something
to give to my kids.

105
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,342
I'm sick of being the dad
that always has to say no.

106
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,648
"Hey, can we go out to dinner?"
"No, you can't."

107
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:52,486
"Dad, can I ha--"
"No, you can't."

108
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,487
Can't afford it,

109
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:54,922
can't afford it,
can't afford it.

110
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,725
It's like--it's like
a knee-jerk reaction with me

111
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:02,463
because I've been so...
broke all year.

112
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:06,634
So, yeah, that--
that prize money would be huge.

113
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,068
There's just no way
I can go home.

114
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,603
I can't go home.

115
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:10,838
So whatever it is
that I have to

116
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,305
endure out here,
I have to endure it.

117
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,607
Whatever it is
I have to put up with,

118
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:14,742
I have to put up
with it.

119
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:15,743
Whatever it is
I have to figure out.

120
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:16,910
I have to figure it out.

121
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:19,847
I have to finish this.

122
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,048
You know, whatever you do,

123
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:24,818
do it all
with the glory of God.

124
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,787
I want to do well.

125
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:37,264
[soft music]

126
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:45,238
*

127
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,748
- I should turn
my headlamp off.

128
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:58,586
So it's, uh, really dark in here
with my headlamp off.

129
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:02,823
So, uh, I went down
and checked my gill net today,

130
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:06,126
and there was a mom
and two cubs down there.

131
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,963
[dramatic music]

132
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:13,400
The bears are here.
[bleep]

133
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,937
- Oh! Mama bear just stood up
on her hind legs.

134
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,138
Not good.

135
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,475
*

136
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:24,878
That was, uh,
that was really exciting.

137
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:27,781
There's a lot
of bear activity right here.

138
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:31,619
And, you know, predators aren't
something to trifle with.

139
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,955
And, uh, I wasn't going
to go disturb them.

140
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,824
Hopefully those bears
will stay on their side

141
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,192
of the wa--
of the river.

142
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:47,167
*

143
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,642
I slept great last night.
Oh, my God.

144
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,777
Went to bed really early.

145
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,014
I got up a little earlier
than usual this morning.

146
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:04,017
Went out,
did a couple of things,

147
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:09,256
and walked around.
Peed.

148
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,826
Now I gotta go
check my gill net.

149
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,295
I'm guessing it'll be empty
just because

150
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,565
salmon aren't running yet,
but one of these mornings

151
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,166
they'll be running.

152
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,837
And that'll be
a glorious day.

153
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,239
I'm gonna go this way
just in case

154
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:27,741
the bears are coming out
that way.

155
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:30,678
I don't wanna
totally shock 'em.

156
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:34,247
I'm not afraid of the bears,
I just don't wanna scare 'em.

157
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,116
You know?
'Cause then they get scared,

158
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:40,688
and then scared animals,
in general, do stupid things.

159
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,791
Hear big splashing
in the water.

160
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,793
I'm just checking out
this tree line.

161
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:48,662
Looking for--
oh, there they go.

162
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,931
Birds are alarming over there.
There's something over there.

163
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:54,568
Holy crap.

164
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:57,170
Oh!
Oh, my God.

165
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,439
Oh, my God.
It's big.

166
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,409
[gasps]
That's beautiful.

167
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,217
There it is.

168
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,788
Glad I went with
the big gill net.

169
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:16,289
All right, hang on.

170
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:19,459
Okay, well this is it.

171
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,762
I caught my first fish
in my net.

172
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,397
It's--
I'm not exaggerating.

173
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:28,301
It's this big.
It's two feet long.

174
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:32,539
Now I gotta make sure I get it
without cutting my gill net.

175
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,343
*

176
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,612
I need something to whack it
over the head really hard with,

177
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:39,847
like a stone.

178
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,482
All right, sweetie.
Here we go.

179
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,485
[dramatic music]

180
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,620
*

181
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:53,593
[dramatic music]

182
00:09:53,627 --> 00:10:01,568
*

183
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:10,911
[water splashing]

184
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,121
- Fish is just too big.

185
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,590
Cutting your head off
really is the best idea.

186
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,759
I don't wanna keep it
in misery.

187
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:28,729
I know.
Try to stay--I know.

188
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:33,400
Gosh.

189
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:37,070
Just severing the spinal cord
real fast.

190
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,806
There'll be a lot of blood
in this water.

191
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,241
Just need to get through--

192
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,210
oh, there we go.

193
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,847
Oh.

194
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,381
These gills are really
bright red.

195
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:49,549
Just looking out for bears

196
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:53,486
'cause they're gonna
smell blood.

197
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,456
It's not very windy today,
which is good.

198
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,627
There we go.

199
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,196
Oh, my God, it's heavy!

200
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,365
This is, like, a feast.

201
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,868
I wish there was someone
to share this with.

202
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,437
It's like--
it's really heavy.

203
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,640
It's a big fish.

204
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,177
*

205
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,880
Colton, these eyeballs
are big.

206
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:23,951
They're like 3/4 of an inch.

207
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,452
You would love these eyeballs,
Colton.

208
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,654
Look at those.
It's got great eyeballs.

209
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,757
My, uh, my son, Colton,
would love that.

210
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,792
When he was little,
someone told him

211
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,961
that if you ate the eyes
of a fish,

212
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,263
you could see underwater.

213
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,065
And he totally believed that.

214
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,666
The size of my thumb,
that eyeball.

215
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,534
Ooh.
I'll cut it out.

216
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:44,437
I'll eat it in honor of you.

217
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:47,240
I'm gonna do this
kinda right here in the water

218
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,009
because when there's blood
coming out,

219
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,312
I don't want the--
I want it to run down.

220
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,681
I don't want it to be
right here.

221
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,818
Oh, so slippery.

222
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,920
Maybe I can balance it
against--

223
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,055
oh, I think it's a male.

224
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:03,924
I see semen.

225
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:10,363
See all that semen in there?
You see that?

226
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:14,101
Yeah, this is all--
that's all semen right here.

227
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,236
Gotta make sure
there's nothing there.

228
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:19,773
Watch out for bears.
They like it right here.

229
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:24,577
*

230
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,613
All right.

231
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:29,817
There.
That opened beautifully.

232
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,785
Just beautifully.
Ta-da.

233
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:34,822
So I've got
the center part done.

234
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:38,926
All right.
Just cut right along the spine

235
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,193
to flatten this fish out.

236
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:44,197
Oh, my God.
It's beautiful.

237
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:47,367
All right,
I think I'm bear-free.

238
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,971
We're all competing
for the same thing.

239
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,173
And the salmon haven't run yet.
The salmon are late,

240
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:56,609
so the bears are, uh,
the bears are hungry.

241
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:59,246
Oh, my God.
It's so heavy.

242
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,781
It is so much meat.

243
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:05,953
So I've got two huge filets
on either side.

244
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,520
Got the center spine.

245
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:09,389
I didn't get right up
as much of the spine

246
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:10,690
as I would've liked.

247
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,960
'Cause I'm gonna eat that too,
for sure.

248
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:16,296
Okay, I'm gonna go, uh,
clean all this off.

249
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,598
Time to bring it up to camp
and get a fire going.

250
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:23,736
*

251
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,307
Let me show you this
smorgasbord I've got going.

252
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,977
I've got salmon in the pan.

253
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,179
Salmon that I put between
two tripods.

254
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,915
I've got fresh cedar sticks
smoking.

255
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:37,084
I'll move it over the fire
when that other one is done

256
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,852
to smoke more.

257
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:41,221
That smoke is going
right into this piece of fish,

258
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,389
which is gonna be great.

259
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,691
Later I'll move it
right over the fire.

260
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:46,826
This fish that I have now
I can keep just for a few days

261
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,128
and just keep eating off it.

262
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,098
As long as I keep it
out of the hands of the bears.

263
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:54,534
Being really careful to keep it
all right on this board

264
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,503
and not to spill any.

265
00:13:56,536 --> 00:14:00,874
'Cause what I don't want
are predators coming around,

266
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:04,744
so I'm going to--
going to make sure that, uh,

267
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,513
that I don't leave anything,
that I burn anything,

268
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,916
and the rest goes way deep
into the ocean.

269
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:12,953
There's my salmon.

270
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:16,156
I'm just gonna eat.

271
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,591
'Cause it's really good.

272
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,260
Oh, my God.

273
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,695
I can't believe
I'm eating this well here.

274
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,899
I am a happy, happy girl.

275
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:31,138
[soft music]

276
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:39,112
*

277
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:51,024
- Today, the priorities
are gonna be

278
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,760
I'm gonna work out
a little bit

279
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:57,397
just to, uh...
[snaps fingers]

280
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,666
get my cylinders firing.

281
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:05,372
Uh, 'cause they're not
right now at all.

282
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,075
I'm not a huge gym buff,
you know?

283
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:10,443
I'm not, like,
a "bro guy," you know?

284
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:13,146
But, uh,
I enjoy working out.

285
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,683
So what I've done is
I've built, basically, a gym.

286
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:19,652
All right, we got, uh...

287
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:24,992
two new additions
to the gym...

288
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,927
AKA: Muscle Beach.

289
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:31,965
'Cause it's a beach
and it's the gym.

290
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,001
First we've brought over
the, uh,

291
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,269
chain that I found.

292
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:39,106
And also...

293
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,674
my new pull-up bar.

294
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,844
Yep.
That happened.

295
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,048
Just knock this out.

296
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,650
I enjoy being
physically active, you know?

297
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:55,522
And I think that it's
an underrated part of survival.

298
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,958
I look at survival,
especially long-term like this,

299
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,427
as living.

300
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,695
You know, I work out
in my own life.

301
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,298
Why wouldn't I work out
out here?

302
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,700
I think some of this comes
from being in the military

303
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,736
for so long as well.

304
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,304
I'm not gonna do it
to the point

305
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:14,574
to where, you know,
I'm expending so many calories

306
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,576
that I'm just draining myself.

307
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:19,312
But it keeps
my motivation levels up.

308
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:23,483
It keeps, you know,
kinda everything up.

309
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,885
Finding things that
you can enjoy

310
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,387
even though
the weather's horrible

311
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,823
or, you know, it's kind of
a miserable existence,

312
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,160
makes a huge, huge impact

313
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:37,230
rather than just kind of
sitting there waiting it out.

314
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:40,133
[groans]

315
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,701
Think when I, uh...
[chuckles]

316
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,904
when I get back,
maybe I should start

317
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:48,941
a survival workout program.

318
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:50,777
That's not gonna happen.

319
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:58,751
*

320
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:22,242
- I never realized sea otters
are such a big creature.

321
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,677
They're like the size
of a small dog.

322
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,914
*

323
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:31,551
What a happy life,
just float around on your back.

324
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,986
Go down, eat some seafood.

325
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,156
Come back up.

326
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,258
Float around on your back,
swim around,

327
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,027
play with your buddies.
That's a cool animal.

328
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,064
*

329
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,399
I'm thinking
what I need to do

330
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:47,900
is catch some
of those sea otters

331
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,002
and train them

332
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:53,005
to bring me fish.

333
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,742
*

334
00:17:55,775 --> 00:18:00,380
They have my cove
all figured out.

335
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,115
This cove is my universe.

336
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:06,486
And I have to adapt myself
to it.

337
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,489
I just have to make use
of what is here

338
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:12,492
and figure it out
and just stay alive.

339
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:19,266
I've got an idea
for active fishing.

340
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:23,503
I can see that there's fish
swimming in the kelp

341
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,538
just below my point here.

342
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:28,141
And this is the first time
I've actually seen fish

343
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:32,779
of a size that I can eat
swimming in my waters.

344
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:37,484
So that means I have to try
and catch some of these fish.

345
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,586
Okay now, the secret to doing
a cane pole

346
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,021
is you don't just tie
the string

347
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:45,825
onto the end of the pole.

348
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,628
You tie yourself
a safety line

349
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:51,898
back below.

350
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,033
*

351
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,269
So if the end
of the pole breaks off,

352
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,405
you don't lose everything.

353
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:01,974
*

354
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,944
I am desperately hungry
right now.

355
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,316
And I want to eat.

356
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:13,052
That's pretty much
the end of the story for me.

357
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,988
*

358
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,858
Oh, man.
That one stole half my bait.

359
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:19,926
They're hitting it though.

360
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:23,696
*

361
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,831
Ah!

362
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:32,805
*

363
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:37,877
Yes!

364
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:52,892
*

365
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,236
- Two weeks out here
and no fish to show for it.

366
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,904
That's embarrassing.
I'm sorry.

367
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,139
I'm at the point now
of total embarrassment

368
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,509
that I have not
caught a fish.

369
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,444
I'm hungry.

370
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:13,012
I'm really hungry.

371
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,582
* *

372
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:18,084
Yes!

373
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,720
Yeah, baby!

374
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,255
Oh, yes.

375
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,824
That's a big ol' fish.

376
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:27,794
I'm gonna have a meal.

377
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,431
I'm gonna have a meal!

378
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,800
*

379
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,436
Oh, thank you, Lord.

380
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,137
*

381
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,307
Oh, I gotta go make
some fish stew.

382
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,544
That is a good feeling.

383
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,113
*

384
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:49,582
It is a lot easier doing this
waist-high

385
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:52,385
than down on the ground.

386
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,987
*

387
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,956
I'm a happy man.

388
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,191
This has definitely taken away
that hollow feeling

389
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,361
that I've had
for the last several days.

390
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,430
It gave me hope today.
It really did.

391
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,465
It really gave me hope.

392
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:07,099
I just want to do well
at this thing, you know?

393
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,469
I just want
to make my kids proud

394
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:14,441
and let them see their dad
persevere and tough it out.

395
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,409
I can feed myself here.

396
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,411
And I need to do that
on a regular basis

397
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,548
to stay here as long
as I possibly can.

398
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:23,516
[exhales deeply]

399
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,061
Thank you, Lord
for this food.

400
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,904
Oh, that is good.

401
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,956
[soft music]

402
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:11,931
*

403
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:24,010
- When I lost my ferro rod,

404
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,145
I wanted to go home.

405
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,814
I need to get my head
back in the game

406
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,116
if I'm gonna do this.

407
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:33,152
I can't just sit around
and hope for--

408
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,286
hope for the best.

409
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,390
I need to take action.

410
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:41,994
I'm gonna start on
a permanent structure today.

411
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:46,198
I'm gonna do it using
two different structural pieces

412
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:47,834
to hold it all together.

413
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,703
I'm gonna be pounding posts
into the ground,

414
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:53,673
and then I'm going to take
a piece of cord,

415
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:57,710
and I'm gonna wrap the cord
around each of the posts

416
00:22:57,744 --> 00:22:59,846
to be able to just
hold it all together.

417
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,281
And then the other way
is I'm going to, uh,

418
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,918
actually notch
each of the logs

419
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:09,422
sort of log cabin style.

420
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:11,257
I'm doing this for two reasons.

421
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,326
You know, one, obviously having
a long-term shelter

422
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,298
and having some comfort
is gonna improve my morale.

423
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,734
It's gonna
just make me happier.

424
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:24,203
Also, two...

425
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,740
winter is coming.

426
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,876
This is one of those projects
that is gonna require

427
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,445
a lot of energy.

428
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:36,215
It's a lot of work going on
very, very little food.

429
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,018
I haven't really eaten any...

430
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:41,220
any meat, so...

431
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,956
I'm definitely, like,
running pretty low on fuel.

432
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,425
Got my trout line out
and traps.

433
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:49,462
That's my first real attempt
at getting some food,

434
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:52,732
but I need to have
a consistent source of food.

435
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:06,045
The process of doing this
without anybody else...

436
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:10,382
the isolation, you know,
is difficult.

437
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,485
It does get to you.

438
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:17,356
Just start to search for
things to--

439
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,091
to communicate with.

440
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,594
Even if it's yourself.

441
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:24,096
You know, like you start having
conversations in your head

442
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,599
where you're talking
to yourself,

443
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,400
and you're saying "we."

444
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:31,270
I'm like, "All right, well what
are we going to do today?"

445
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,672
"We"?
What am I talking about?

446
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:34,707
There's no "we."
It's just me out here.

447
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:36,809
And that is arguably
the most difficult part

448
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:38,978
of this journey.

449
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:42,348
So these are the walls
on the inside.

450
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:45,585
Barely even see.
Let's turn on the infrared.

451
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:48,254
So that's as high
as my back wall is gonna be.

452
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:52,024
It's basically just a log cabin
lean-to essentially.

453
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:54,627
Here's what it looks like
from the outside.

454
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,096
[chuckles]

455
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,231
Amazing.

456
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:03,369
The process has been definitely
laborous and exhausting.

457
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:07,139
And it's taking a lot
of calories out of me.

458
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,240
[groans]

459
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:11,410
[bleep], I'm hungry.

460
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,413
[soft music]

461
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:22,388
*

462
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,193
- All right.

463
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:30,663
I gotta get moving 'cause
it's a little chill in the air.

464
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,531
I could see my breath last night
when I went to bed.

465
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:34,333
[exhales]

466
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:39,572
*

467
00:25:39,606 --> 00:25:41,774
It's really feeling
like the rain is coming.

468
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:44,076
And I have a feeling
once the rain comes.

469
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,778
we're just in for the rain.

470
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:50,583
It's not gonna stop,
so getting ready.

471
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:54,587
This is the front
of my shelter.

472
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:57,489
So I've started to put
a door in.

473
00:25:57,523 --> 00:25:59,692
These are my final--
this post on the left

474
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:02,662
and this post on my right
are my final two beams.

475
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:05,231
This thing leaning in here...

476
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:06,999
it's going to be my door

477
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:10,169
that will come in and out.

478
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:13,305
*

479
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,975
There are some big storms
that come through here.

480
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,510
*

481
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:20,747
I know that the storms
are gonna hit really soon,

482
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:24,083
and rain is just gonna be...
[whooshing]

483
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:29,288
This door fits pretty snugly.

484
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,591
Now I'm reinforcing the front
of this structure

485
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:35,394
to make sure that
the whole thing is covered.

486
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,797
Hopefully this will keep both

487
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,732
the warmth in
and the cold out,

488
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:43,469
but also the wind out
as well.

489
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:48,507
Perhaps we'll see
rain tonight.

490
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,510
[dramatic music]

491
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:59,485
*

492
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:22,809
- Well, I wouldn't want to be
out on a raft

493
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:25,678
on this.

494
00:27:25,712 --> 00:27:28,948
Normally this water's
really calm.

495
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:32,151
Just passive.

496
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:34,653
It's just super rocky today.

497
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:43,629
The wind has been
going crazy fast.

498
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,166
Like tornado.

499
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:50,336
I don't know.
I mean, I'd say...

500
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:55,341
probably, you know,
40-50 mile an hour winds easy.

501
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:58,677
Just, you know, kicking.

502
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:02,348
*

503
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:04,350
And now it's raining.

504
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:07,086
And I gotta go back to camp.

505
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,320
[bleep].

506
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:11,457
*

507
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,959
All right.

508
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:15,161
[groans]

509
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,595
[grunts]

510
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:24,570
*

511
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:43,622
[heavy raindrops]

512
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:48,795
- Yeah, hey.

513
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:52,799
It's really coming down,
so I have the, uh,

514
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:54,200
thought I'd turn
the audio on here.

515
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,567
[heavy raindrops]

516
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:58,504
My, uh, lean-to
is not leaking at all.

517
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:01,307
We have had intense rain,
so...

518
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,442
I feel really snug.

519
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,644
It is really dark though.

520
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:08,214
I'm, uh, getting ready to go.

521
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,949
Got my raincoat on,

522
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,851
and I'm gonna go check
my gill net.

523
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:14,286
And the storm's going...
[whooshing]

524
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,422
King of whipping around.

525
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,858
It's really sheltered in this,
uh, in this hut.

526
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,159
I don't think you can hear it
as much

527
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:22,128
as is actually going on.

528
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,134
Whoo.

529
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:52,158
Ahh!

530
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:54,293
Oh, my God,
I'm getting blown over!

531
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,998
Wow, that was crazy.

532
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:02,969
My gill net
is way underwater.

533
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:05,371
Looks...

534
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:07,506
I think a lot of it's
showing,

535
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,740
but I can't get to it.

536
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:10,376
It's way too--

537
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:15,581
It seems like the water's
really just blowing...

538
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:18,717
in, which is--

539
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,853
like, the waves are coming
and making it hard to get to--

540
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:22,421
to the--that area.

541
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:24,456
I'll have to keep
watching it today.

542
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,892
Yeah, it's really raining.

543
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:27,927
I'm gonna, um,
I'm gonna head back to camp

544
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,963
and, uh,
before I get gusted away here.

545
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,068
Just kinda get settled in
for the day.

546
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:39,071
[dramatic music]

547
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:45,044
*

548
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,326
- I came out to the beach
this morning

549
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,362
just to check things out.

550
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:05,965
This is about as high tide
as high gets.

551
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:08,234
And the surf
is just amazing here.

552
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:09,735
I've never seen it
this rough.

553
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:13,339
That's where I clean my fish,
on that twisty-looking thing

554
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,841
where the surf is
beating down right now.

555
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,879
If I was to go fishing,
that's where I'd go fishing.

556
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:23,950
All the way out there.

557
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:26,919
I would have to cross
all that water

558
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:29,255
to get to my fishing spot.

559
00:31:29,288 --> 00:31:31,790
Normally at low tide,
I can walk out there.

560
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:34,726
Look at it now.
It's just surf.

561
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,098
And this is--this is as rough
as I've seen it.

562
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:43,202
The water is murky
and evil-looking.

563
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,971
*

564
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:48,574
This is a tragedy, people.

565
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:54,813
My giant twisty kitchen thing
is drifting out to sea.

566
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,583
That is the most important
feature of my beach,

567
00:31:57,616 --> 00:32:02,854
and it's leaving.
Come on, don't go! No!

568
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,823
No!

569
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:13,499
[dramatic music]

570
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:21,473
*

571
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:45,697
- I'm so scared.

572
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:47,666
[chuckles]

573
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:51,703
[coughs]

574
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:54,173
Oh.

575
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,111
The wind is really crazy.

576
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:01,580
It's not raining too much,

577
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:06,585
but the wind
is just going nuts.

578
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:09,755
Don't really have much to do

579
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:11,490
in the way
of chores or work.

580
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:14,426
Everything is pretty--

581
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,296
pretty much revolving
around food.

582
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:21,800
And tide's about halfway up,

583
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,770
so there's no food to get.

584
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:30,209
I might just hunker down
in here.

585
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:36,948
You know, over the course
of active duty in the military,

586
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:40,952
years of my life
had been spent in isolation.

587
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:42,788
You're sitting in a tiny hole
with, you know,

588
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:43,789
a couple of other guys

589
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:45,924
for three, four, or five days.

590
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,160
And you're pissing
and [bleep] in a bag, you know.

591
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:51,463
You learn things to do
to kinda entertain your mind.

592
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:58,304
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

593
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:00,439
the moment that probably

594
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:02,341
none of you
have been waiting for,

595
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,642
other than me.

596
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,752
When I first saw
this bad boy,

597
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:17,823
I was thinking,
"That is a tube.

598
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:21,927
And I can use the tube
for a lot of cool stuff."

599
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,531
And hopefully we can
give it a little--

600
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,633
little test drive here.

601
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,676
And that is a win.

602
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:43,449
No longer do I have to leave

603
00:34:43,482 --> 00:34:46,218
the comfort of my room

604
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:50,489
to urinate
in the middle of the night.

605
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:53,659
Believe it or not,
it's a pretty big moment.

606
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:56,662
[soft music]

607
00:34:56,695 --> 00:35:04,636
*

608
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:11,042
- Rainy day, windy day.

609
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:13,044
Very windy day.

610
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:16,715
Wouldn't want to be out at sea
on a day like this.

611
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:18,384
*

612
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:39,338
I'm gonna go walk over--
walk over to the fish net.

613
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,240
See if I can rescue it.

614
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:43,675
Let's see what
the situation is.

615
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:45,377
A lot of stuff in the net.

616
00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:47,679
Like kelp pieces and whatnot.

617
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:49,215
You have to go in the water.

618
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:52,651
We're basically freeing it
then make it work again.

619
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:55,487
That's the last darn day

620
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:58,490
a guy would want to be
wading in the water here,

621
00:35:58,524 --> 00:36:01,593
but it's hard to see
how deep it is.

622
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:03,662
Ooh.

623
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:05,297
[grunts]

624
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:07,866
It's already past
knee-deep here.

625
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:11,837
Probably going to drown here
like an idiot.

626
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,606
And the wind picks up
some more.

627
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,244
*

628
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:20,246
What a tangle.

629
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:22,314
*

630
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:24,283
[grunts]

631
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,519
Lot of kelp.

632
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:30,989
Oh, man. I could do without
these waves, I tell you.

633
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:35,561
*

634
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:38,697
Huh.
There's a salmon in here.

635
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,032
Lordy!

636
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:44,703
Well, that's a reward.

637
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,105
Salmon.

638
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,475
Not too big, but not bad.

639
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,779
[heavy raindrops]

640
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:58,517
I don't know if you folks
can even hear anything.

641
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:04,423
'Cause it's raining
about as hard as it can

642
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:07,058
but I'm eating salmon.

643
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:11,062
so I don't care.

644
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,736
I'm having the best meal...

645
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:22,007
I've had
since I've come here.

646
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,743
So the salmon are coming
towards the coast.

647
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:27,178
They're looking for places.

648
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:40,526
[dramatic music]

649
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:48,500
*

650
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:55,641
- Good morning.

651
00:37:57,643 --> 00:38:00,746
It's another beautiful day
here in British Columbia.

652
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,550
What else can I say?

653
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,489
Gonna walk down and...

654
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:12,358
gonna check my traps.

655
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:15,994
*

656
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:19,465
Trap number one.

657
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:21,933
Not triggered.

658
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,870
And the bait is gone.

659
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,338
Man.

660
00:38:26,372 --> 00:38:29,975
I need to figure out a way
to make this way more sensitive.

661
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:37,683
*

662
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:41,853
- Think I'm gonna try
to start eating these slugs.

663
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,126
I don't want to, but...

664
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,561
I'm getting pretty hungry.

665
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:54,132
*

666
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,133
Next trap.

667
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,969
*

668
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,005
Triggered.

669
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:02,307
Do we have anything
to show for it?

670
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,310
*

671
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,278
Oh, my God.
Look at that.

672
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:13,785
*

673
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:21,760
*

674
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:36,608
- Nice.

675
00:39:36,642 --> 00:39:39,745
A little mouse.

676
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:43,381
My first bit of meat
in 14 days.

677
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:48,386
All right, well let's cook up
our mousey-mouse here.

678
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:55,427
What I like to do is just...

679
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:57,829
singe all the hair off.

680
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,503
So this guy is all singed.

681
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:07,172
And then you could just...

682
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:08,474
you don't need to spend
too much time

683
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:09,808
skinning him or anything.

684
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:13,078
You just sort of peel
the singed hair off.

685
00:40:16,114 --> 00:40:18,884
I'm super excited to eat this
right now.

686
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,486
You could just peel open
the stomach

687
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,853
to take out the guts.

688
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:25,957
But I leave in, like,
the heart and the liver.

689
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:32,531
Delicious.

690
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:34,332
Mm-hmm.

691
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:38,504
And I'll just throw him
directly on the coals there.

692
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:40,105
Just let him cook.

693
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:42,173
*

694
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:46,678
I feel like I'm starting
to find my pace.

695
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:51,617
I'm starting to connect more
with the land.

696
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:56,054
But I'm just not
pulling in any fish.

697
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:57,623
*

698
00:40:57,656 --> 00:40:59,658
So I don't know.

699
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:01,927
I gotta try
some new fishing techniques.

700
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,730
Gotta try to make a living
off the sea.

701
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:06,698
Because when winter comes here,

702
00:41:06,732 --> 00:41:10,401
animals are gonna be holed up
and might not be there,

703
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:14,072
so I gotta figure out a way
to get some fish.

704
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:17,543
*

705
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:19,511
Little leg.

706
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:22,981
Mmm.

707
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:44,402
And that's the only bit
that's left.

708
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:47,673
Just the teeth.

709
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:53,444
The teeth are just too hard.

710
00:41:56,447 --> 00:42:00,085
Actually, no, they're fine.

711
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:01,052
All gone.

712
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:08,760
[sighs]

713
00:42:08,794 --> 00:42:10,729
Well, that's it.

714
00:42:12,598 --> 00:42:15,533
Breakfast of champions there.

715
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:21,339
- If I end up in the drink
and swimming,

716
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,475
then this could be
the end of my journey today.

717
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:26,544
- You build and you build
and you build,

718
00:42:26,578 --> 00:42:28,146
and when you run out of things,

719
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,948
then you're just sort of
left here.

720
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:32,317
- A mouse has completely
destroyed my gear.

721
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,552
I swear to God if that thing
chews my sleeping bag up,

722
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:36,221
I'm blowing this place up.

723
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:38,223
- I've never been alone
for this long before.

724
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:40,558
I am craving
human companionship.

725
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:43,461
- I really miss
my loved ones.

726
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:44,896
Oh.

727
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:49,735
